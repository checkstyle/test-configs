             patterns that PMD incorrectly flags as unguarded log statements. -->

    <rule ref="category/java/codestyle.xml">

             less verbose code without redundant access modifiers. -->
        <exclude name="CommentDefaultAccessModifier"/>
        <!-- OnlyOneReturn is excluded because multiple return points are sometimes
             necessary for clarity and to avoid deep nesting. -->
        <exclude name="OnlyOneReturn"/>
        <!-- AtLeastOneConstructor is excluded as not all utility classes
             require a constructor, and including one would add unnecessary code. -->
