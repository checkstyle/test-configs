# Checkstyle Test Configurations Generator

This repository stores and generates configurations for diff.groovy testing in the Checkstyle project.

## Using the Configurations

1. Navigate to the specific module directory you're interested in.
2. Open the `README.md` file in that directory.
3. Add a comment in the PR exactly as shown under
   "Trigger report generation by comment in Pull Request:" in the README.

This will trigger the regression testing using the generated configuration.
