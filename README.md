# Checkstyle Test Configurations Generator

This repository stores and generates configurations for diff.groovy testing in the Checkstyle project.

## Using the Configurations

1. Navigate to the specific module directory you're interested in.
2. Open the `README.md` file in that directory.
3. Copy the content under "Paste below given to PR description to use such test configs:"
4. Paste this content into your Checkstyle pull request description.
5. Add a comment in the PR exactly as shown under "Make comment in PR:" in the README.

This will trigger the regression testing using the generated configuration.
